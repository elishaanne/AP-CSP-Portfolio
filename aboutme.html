        <center><p>Hi, my name is Elisha Anne Santos. I was born on July 1 and I am 16 years old. I am the third Santos sibling out of four kids,<br> which means I have middle child syndrome a.k.a the forgotten child, but I think I am turning out just fine. I have an older brother,<br> Ynah, an older sister, Dindi, and a younger brother, Jared. My siblings and I have pretty big gaps as my oldest brother graduated<br> from Don Lugo in 2011, my sister graduated from Don Lugo in 2018, and my youngest brother is only in 4th grade. Music and<br> singing are my escape from this fast paced and constantly changing world. I enjoy spending time with my family and close friends,<br> listening/playing music, playing tennis, eating, sleeping, napping, binge watching on Netflix or Hulu. I am a total sucker for puns<br> and anything High School Musical related. My favorite thing to do is travel with my family and friends. So far, I have been to Canada,<br> the Phillippines, Japan, Taiwan, and Mexico. As I grow older, I hope to continue to grow my list of places I have been <br>and tell the stories of my adventures.</p>
       <p>Want to see more about me:</p>
