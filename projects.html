        <p style=font-size:115%>Over the course of the AP Computer Science class, we have worked on different projects. <br>After practicing and trying to perfect different skills, we would share our creations and make them public for everyone to see. <br>Some of my projects and creations are showed below.</p>

    <p class="a" style=font-size:125%>For this project, we were given the task to create a storyboard or game. My partner, Yasmin Corel, and I <br>decided to create a storyboard/choose-your-own adventure game. The storyline of the game is about<br> two characters named Ron Stoppable and Kim Possible (from the hit 2000s disney channel show Kim Possible)<br> who have to attend a regular day of highschool. The goal of the game is to help your character obtain a sports scholarship.<br> The user is given many different options to help their character achieve the goal.The process of creating<br> this game was split into small tasks so it was easier to complete the whole game and find the little bugs and glitches earlier.<br> The gameâ€™s programming consists of many broadcast signals that would trigger decisions markers to disappear <br>or appear, as well as, make the birds talk and have different dialogues. We also nested several<br> if-then statements, which was a main portion in making the game functioning. The skills that I have learned and<br> practiced through the creation of the game allow me to understand the behind the scenes of games and animations.<br>Also, these new skills allow me to understand coding and algorthims which are the basics of computer science.<br>CLICK THE KIMMUNICATOR PHONE DOWN BELOW TO PLAY THE GAME!</p>

    <p class="a" style=font-size:125%>The task in this assignment was to create an app create an app that addresses a personal, practical, or societal issue.<br>For this project, Alexia Montenegro -my partner- and I created an interactive random generator app. If a person is <br>unoccupied and needs something to do, this app would be perfect for them. Activity Generator helps people pick/ gives them<br> ideas of what they can do. The app's programming contained many lists, which are abstractions that reduce the complexity <br>of the code in order to run efficiently. The app contains categories of activities that the user can choose<br> from to help personalize the activity to them. Some new skills that i have learned are how to strategize to create a new app, how getting <br>bugs on the app is aprt of the process, and how abstractions work to make the code less complex. This app is<br> only available on Android devices, but your boredness will definitely be satisfied.<br> click the machine icon to download its Android Package Kit</p>
