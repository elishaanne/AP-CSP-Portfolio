        <p style=font-size:115%>Over the course of the AP Computer Science class, we have worked on different projects. <br>After practicing and trying to perfect different skills, we wold share our creations and make them public for everyone to see. <br>Some of my projects and creations are showed below.</p>

    <p style=font-size:125%>For this project, we were given the task to create a storyboard or game. My partner, Yasmin Corel, and I <br>decided to create a storyboard/choose-your-own adventure game. The storyline of the game is about<br> two characters named Ron Stoppable and Kim Possible (from the hit 2000s disney channel show Kim Possible)<br> who have to attend a regular day of highschool. The goal of the game is to help your character obtain a sports scholarship.<br> The user is given many different options to help their character achieve the goal.The process of creating<br> this game was split into small tasks so it was easier to complete the whole game and find the little bugs and glitches earlier.<br> The gameâ€™s programming consists of many broadcast signals that would trigger decisions markers to disappear <br>or appear, as well as, make the birds talk and have different dialogues. We also nested several<br> if-then statements, which was a main portion in making the game functioning. The skills that I have learned and<br> practiced through the creation of the game allow me to understand the behind the scenes of games and animations.<br>Also, these new skills allow me to understand coding and algorthims which are the basics of computer science.<br>Click the Kimmunicator phone to play the game!</p>
