    <h1 style=font-size:270%> My Projects</h1>
        <p style=font-size:115%>Over the course of the AP Computer Science class, we have worked on different projects. <br>After practicing and trying to perfect different skills, we would share our creations and make them public for everyone to see. <br>Some of my projects and creations are showed below.</p>

        <p class="a" style=font-size:125%>For this project, we were given the task to create a storyboard or game. My partner, Yasmin Corel, and I <br>decided to create a storyboard/choose-your-own adventure game. The storyline of the game is about<br> two characters named Ron Stoppable and Kim Possible (from the hit 2000s disney channel show Kim Possible)<br> who have to attend a regular day of highschool. The goal of the game is to help your character obtain a sports scholarship.<br> The user is given many different options to help their character achieve the goal.The process of creating<br> this game was split into small tasks so it was easier to complete the whole game and find the little bugs and glitches earlier.<br> The game’s programming consists of many broadcast signals that would trigger decisions markers to disappear <br>or appear, as well as, make the birds talk and have different dialogues. We also nested several<br> if-then statements, which was a main portion in making the game functioning. The skills that I have learned and<br> practiced through the creation of the game allow me to understand the behind the scenes of games and animations.<br>Also, these new skills allow me to understand coding and algorthims which are the basics of computer science.<br>CLICK THE KIMMUNICATOR PHONE DOWN BELOW TO PLAY THE GAME!</p>

        <p class="a" style=font-size:125%>The task in this assignment was to create an app create an app that addresses a personal, practical, or societal issue.<br>For this project, Alexia Montenegro -my partner- and I created an interactive random generator app. If a person is <br>unoccupied and needs something to do, this app would be perfect for them. Activity Generator helps people pick/ gives them<br> ideas of what they can do. The app's programming contained many lists, which are abstractions that reduce the complexity <br>of the code in order to run efficiently. The app contains categories of activities that the user can choose<br> from to help personalize the activity to them. Some new skills that i have learned are how to strategize to create a new app, how getting <br>bugs on the app is aprt of the process, and how abstractions work to make the code less complex. This app is<br> only available on Android devices, but your boredness will definitely be satisfied.<br> Click the machine icon to download its Android Package Kit</p>

        <p class="a" style=font-size:125%> My partner, Antonio Martinez, and I created a code on python that allows the user to find the<br> geometric calculations for volume, area, and perimeter. This allows users to calculate the value<br> needed without memorizing the formula as the calculator will compute it all for you. <br>The code contains controlled structures such as if-elif-else statements and even while statements. The <br>code also contains many different functions that are called on depending on the user's input.<br> If you have any geometric calculation needs, specifically for volume, area, and perimeter, <br>you would definetly enjoy this code. <br> Click the calculator below for your geometry needs.</p>

        <p class="a" style=font-size:125%> In this task, we were asked to identify a computational innovation in the world. I chose drones.<br> Through this infographic, you can learn how a drone works, facts about drones, and even<br> the positive and negative effects the drone poses on society, the economy, and culture.<br> The infographic was created through the website canva.com. Canvan allowed me - a person <br>with no graphic-design background - to easily create a design with the information<br> and research that i discovered.<br> To check out Canva.com click on the paint brush below and<br> To check out my documentation click on the pencil picture.</p>

    <h1 style="background-color:silver">Vulnerable User: Malware</h1>
        <p class="a" style=font-size:125%> During this project, my class first learned how there are many different kinds of <br>cyber attacks that occur over the internet. Attackers try to control all the information<br> possible on a person's computer. To do this, they use malware. During this activity,<br> I learned that there many different kinds of malware that attackers use. They <br>all however, just try to take advantage of the user and their information. In this project, I learned <br>that all computers have a weakness or vulnerability that can be exploited by <br>someone who would like to have access to unauthorized actions in a system.<br>The presentation in the link below is on the malware the conficker. <br>To learn more about the conficker, Click the picture below to go to my powerpoint presentation.</p>

        <p class="a" style="font-size:125%">Model simulations allow real world problems to be simulated and studied inorder to be<br>provided the potential behavior of the issue. In this task, my partner, Jason P., and I, selected<br> the simulation "rabbits grass weeds" because the field of ecology was an intrest to us both. <br>We wanted to see how certain populations fluctuate from increasing to decreasing due to<br> specific circumstances. I learned how to add new variables and code it into the simulation. <br>The code for the simulation was actually worded much differently than what I have seen <br>before, but with the help of my partner, we reviewed some of the original code and began to<br> understand it more. We then added new circumstances and variables.One of the new added<br> variables (predator-fox) allowed the predictive power of the simulation to increase and <br>become more realistic. Now, it would more accurately represent the environment and how <br>wild life is much more complex than what can be seen.<br> To download the simulation for netlogo click the picture below. </p>

    <h1 style="background-color:silver">Investigate with Data</h1>
        <img src="images/investigatedata.PNG" width="450" height="300">
        <p class="a" style=font-size:125%>My partner for this project was Yasmin Corel and when choosing the field of data for the topic of <br>sports, we thought that how many injuries, most watched sport, and the income in a specific sport<br> were the most obtainable pieces of data we could find online. After careful deliberation and <br>connecting the possible fields of data the questions were created. The question that was most <br>interesting was ‘Does the most watched sport receive the most income?’ This question began our<br> search for data because money, through it can not buy happiness, is an important part of our <br>everyday lives and sports are the first kind of entertainment that appeal to a wide age range of<br> individuals. Together, the question for the data was formed. In this project, I learned how to sort <br>through data for what we needed, how to analyze the data in comparison to one another, and how <br>to create a visual to show my results. One of the most important things I learned in the process of<br> making this visual(shown above), is that income data is skewed and instead of using the average to <br>compare the sets of data, I should use the median since the median isnt affected by the extreme values.<br>Check out my data and documentation by clicking the picture below </p>

        <p class="a" style="font-size:125%">This project was actually submitted as apart of my AP portfolio. For this project, I worked<br> independently as I created the app Life Plan (also known as Get My Life Togther). This app <br>was created on MIT App Inventor and is intended to allow the user to have a weekly agenda,<br> checklist, and even a motivational quote generator. The app's programming contained lists, if-then <br>logic statements, and mathmatical statements too. In this project, I learned how to utilize the<br> procedures that I created. These abstactions allowed me to use the code multiple times without <br>having to repeat the code over and over again. Once again, I also learned that bugs and having a <br>difficult time with the code is apart of the creating process, but I tried my best to make everything <br>work out in the end. The app is only available on android devices,<br> but if you would like to see my documentation, click the phone below. </p>

        <p class="a" style="font-size:125%">This performance task was also submitted as apart of my AP portfolio. The artifact and research I <br>independently conducted was on the computational innovation- Ring doorbell. I choose this <br>innovation because I see them being installed on more and more homes and has become extremely<br> relevant today. I created this artifact on Canva.com. Each picture has the intention of demonstrating<br> the purpose and function of the doorbell. Ring Doorbell allows the home owner/app user to see<br> who is at the door even if they arent home. I learned that every innovation has countless effects- some<br> positive, some negative. Either way, the innovation not only has an impact on society,<br> but also on the economy and even culture.<br> To learn more about Ring Doorbell, read my documentation when you click the door below.</p>
